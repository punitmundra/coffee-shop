Use Cases:
===========

1. Customers enter, place orders, and only have so much patience for a
   busy line. Each customer gets in line, but they will leave if they
need to wait too long for their order.

2. Barista's fulfill orders to the best of their abilities. Their
   abilities range from 1.0 (which is perfect ability) to higher numbers
which are multiples of the optimal drink preparation time.

3. The store manager ensure that inventory is properly stocked and
   accounted for.
